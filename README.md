# Miss face-to-face? Just choose a place!

## Overview
OnlyMeals is a platform for individuals to encourage face-to-face-interactions through **having meals with each other *based on proximity***. 
Individuals select the venue of where they would like to eat based on the locations near to them. 
They would be matched with others who have selected the same venue. After being matched, they could
